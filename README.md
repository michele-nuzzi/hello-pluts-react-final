# hello-pluts-react

this is a starter template for a [`plu-ts`](https://github.com/HarmonicLabs/plu-ts) + [`mesh`](https://github.com/MeshJS/mesh) project;

to complete this project refer to the[`Hello plu-ts` example project in the `plu-ts` documentation](https://pluts.harmoniclabs.tech/docs/examples/Hello%20World)


## Run the example in pluts-emulator

This example has been upgraded to support either Blockfrost or Emulator providers. 

- `npm run dev:emulator` enables running the example with emulator, simulating the blockchain interactions locally while still enabling connecting to a browser wallet.
